## Introduction
*Hello, We are the Bug-Squashers Team. We worked together to create a chatting application, where users can create certain groups to have converstions with Friends, Family and Everyone In-Between.*

### How to access the code:
**First**, *you should create the directory in which you want the code to exist in, after that we download/load in the (vite + react) application with the command:'npm create vite@latest'.*
*Finally, after the application base loads in yiu cd into the directory that will be given to you, followed by typing out npm install and the going into you code editor(**VS.CODE**) and you can now begin to do your editing.*

*Happy-Coding!*

**Technologies Used In the creation of the Application**:

<li>REACT/VITE
<li>FireBase
<li>ChatEngine
<li>Visual Studio Code
